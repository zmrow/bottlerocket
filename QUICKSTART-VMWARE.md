# Using Bottlerocket as a Kubernetes worker node with VMware

> The [VMware variant](variants/README.md#vmware-k8s-120-vmware-kubernetes-120-node) is currently in preview phase and we're looking for [feedback](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket#contact-us).
> Please try it out and let us know what you think!

This quickstart will walk through joining a Bottlerocket VM guest to an existing Kubernetes cluster running in VMware.

## Prerequisites

You must be able to access vSphere, via webUI or some type of client.
We will use the CLI tool [`govc`](https://github.com/vmware/govmomi/tree/master/govc) to communicate with vSphere in this quide.
`govc` can use [environment variables or take arguments](https://github.com/vmware/govmomi/tree/master/govc#usage) to specify needed parameters.
For the purposes of this guide we will assume that the following environment variables are set to the proper values in your environment:
```
GOVC_URL
GOVC_USERNAME
GOVC_PASSWORD
GOVC DATACENTER
GOVC_DATASTORE
GOVC_NETWORK
GOVC_RESOURCE_POOL
GOVC_FOLDER
```

This guide assumes you already have a functioning Kubernetes cluster running in VMware.
You'll need to have [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) and [`kubeadm`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubeadm) installed, as well as a `kubeconfig` for your cluster.
These tools allow us to access information about your cluster to facilitate the joining of Bottlerocket nodes.

You'll need to install [`tuftool`](https://github.com/awslabs/tough/blob/develop/tuftool/README.md) to assist you with fetching the signed Bottlerocket OVA from the Bottlerocket TUF repository.
We're working on making this a better experience for users that do not want to install `tuftool`.

## Fetch the OVA

The Bottlerocket OVA is signed and uploaded alongside the rest of the Bottlerocket release artifacts.

You first need the Bottlerocket root role, which is used by `tuftool` to verify the OVA.
The following will download and verify the root role itself:

```
curl -O "https://cache.bottlerocket.aws/root.json"
sha512sum -c <<<"90393204232a1ad6b0a45528b1f7df1a3e37493b1e05b1c149f081849a292c8dafb4ea5f7ee17bcc664e35f66e37e4cfa4aae9de7a2a28aa31ae6ac3d9bea4d5  root.json"
```

Next, set your desired version and variant, and download the OVA:
```
VERSION="v1.1.0"
VARIANT="vmware-k8s-1.20"

tuftool download . --target-name bottlerocket-${VARIANT}-x86_64-${VERSION}.ova \
   --root ./root.json \
   --metadata-url "https://updates.bottlerocket.aws/2020-07-07/${VARIANT}/x86_64/" \
   --targets-url "https://updates.bottlerocket.aws/targets/"
```

## Upload the OVA

Once you have downloaded the OVA, you can upload it to vSphere.

The first command generates a spec file (`bottlerocket_spec.json` in this case) using the OVA and gives you few options for your deployment.
```
govc import.spec <bottlerocket...ova> > bottlerocket_spec.json
```

The spec will look similar to this:
```
{
  "DiskProvisioning": "flat",
  "IPAllocationPolicy": "dhcpPolicy",
  "IPProtocol": "IPv4",
  "NetworkMapping": [
    {
      "Name": "VM Network",
      "Network": ""
    }
  ],
  "MarkAsTemplate": false,
  "PowerOn": false,
  "InjectOvfEnv": false,
  "WaitForIP": false,
  "Name": null
}
```

You must enter valid values for the `Network` and `Name`.
`Network` must correspond to the network in which you intend to deploy this VM.
`Name` can be anything you want, it is the name of the VM that will be created.

Once you've edited the file, you can use it to upload the OVA!
```
govc import.ova -options=bottlerocket_spec.json <bottlerocket...ova>
```

> Note: `govc import.ova` also takes a `-name=` argument that allows you to use the same spec file but override the VM name on future uploads.
> For example: `govc import.ova -options=bottlerocket_spec.json -name="BottlerocketIsNeat" <bottlerocket...ova>`

### Creating a template

If you intend to run many identical VMs, you can mark the OVA you just uploaded as a template.
You **must** to do this before you boot and configure Bottlerocket, since user data configuration will be unique between nodes!
You can think of a template as a "golden" image, allowing you to create many VMs without affecting the "golden" image.

The following command marks the VM as a template:
```
govc vm.markastemplate <YOUR VM NAME>
```

## Gathering cluster info

This section will help you gather cluster information needed to configure Bottlerocket via user data.
The below commands assume a single cluster.

#### API Server
This is the address (including port) of the control plane.
```
export API_SERVER="$(kubectl config view -o jsonpath='{.clusters[0].cluster.server}')"
```

#### Cluster DNS IP
This is the IP address of the DNS pod/service.
```
export CLUSTER_DNS_IP="$(kubectl -n kube-system get svc -l k8s-app=kube-dns -o=jsonpath='{.items[0].spec.clusterIP}')"
```

#### Bootstrap token
Nodes require a token to establish trust between the node and the control plane.
Tokens must be [used within 24 hours](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/kubeadm-token/), but once the node has booted and registered with the cluster, it isn't used again.
```
export BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN="$(kubeadm token create)"
```

#### Cluster Certificate
This is the base64 encoded cluster certificate authority.
```
export CLUSTER_CERTIFICATE="$(kubectl config view --raw -o=jsonpath='{.clusters[0].cluster.certificate-authority-data}')"
```

## Configuring Bottlerocket

In order to join Bottlerocket to your cluster, it must be configured via user data.
There are multiple methods of passing user data to Bottlerocket in VMware; we will demonstrate all of them.

Create a file called `userdata.toml` and populate it with the values you just retrieved.
```
cat <<EOF > userdata.toml
[settings.kubernetes]
api-server = "${API_SERVER:-<API_SERVER>}"
cluster-dns-ip = "${CLUSTER_DNS_IP:-<CLUSTER_DNS_IP>}"
bootstrap-token = "${BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN:-<BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN>}"
cluster-certificate = "${CLUSTER_CERTIFICATE:-<CLUSTER_CERTIFICATE>}"
EOF
```

### Accessing your Bottlerocket guest via host containers
For remote access to your running Bottlerocket VMs, you will need to add additional user data to enable host containers.
The Bottlerocket VMware images don't include any host containers enabled by default.
But don't worry!
You can use our [admin](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-admin-container) and/or [control](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-control-container) containers, they just need to be configured first.

#### Admin container
If you would like to use the admin container, you will need to create some base64 encoded user data which will be passed to the container at runtime.
Full details are covered in the [admin container documentation](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-admin-container#authenticating-with-the-admin-container).
If we assume you have a public key at `${HOME}/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`, the below will add the correct user data to your `userdata.toml`.
```
PUBKEY="${HOME}/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
ADMIN_USER_DATA="$(echo '{"ssh":{"authorized-keys":["'"$(cat ${PUBKEY})"'"]}}' | base64 -w 0)"

cat <<EOF >>userdata.toml
[settings.host-containers.admin]
enabled=true
user-data = "${ADMIN_USER_DATA:-<ADMIN_USER_DATA>}"
EOF
```

#### Control container
Enabling the control container is very similar to the admin container; you will create some base64 encoded user data that will be passed to the container at runtime.
This user data includes an activation ID and code retrieved from AWS SSM.
Full details can be found in the [control container documentation](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-control-container#connecting-to-aws-systems-manager-ssm).

You'll first need an AWS account, and AWS CLI installed.
Then you'll create a service role in that account to [grant AWS STS trust to the AWS Systems Manager service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-service-role.html).
```
cat <<EOF > ssmservice-trust.json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
            "Service": "ssm.amazonaws.com"
        },
        "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
}
EOF

# Create the role using the above policy
aws iam create-role \
    --role-name SSMServiceRole \
    --assume-role-policy-document file://ssmservice-trust.json

# Attach the policy enabling the role to create session tokens
aws iam attach-role-policy \
    --role-name SSMServiceRole \
    --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore  
```

Once the above is created, we can use the role to create an activation code and ID.
```
export SSM_ACTIVATION="$(aws ssm create-activation \
  --default-instance-name MyVMwareVMs \
  --description "Activation for VMware VMs" \
  --iam-role SSMServiceRole \
  --registration-limit 1 \
  --region us-west-2 \
  --output json)"
```

Using the above activation data we can create our user data to pass to the control container
```
SSM_ACTIVATION_ID="$(jq -r '.ActivationId' <<< ${SSM_ACTIVATION})"
SSM_ACTIVATION_CODE="$(jq -r '.ActivationCode' <<< ${SSM_ACTIVATION})"
CONTROL_USER_DATA="$(echo '{"ssm":{"activation-id":"${SSM_ACTIVATION_ID}","activation-code":"${SSM_ACTIVATION_CODE}","region":"us-west-2"}}' | base64 -w0)"

[settings.host-containers.control]
enabled = true
user-data= "${CONTROL_USER_DATA:-<CONTROL_USER_DATA>}"
```

### Setting user data via "guestinfo" interface
**Note: You must set these values before you start the VM for the first time!**

VMware allows you to set some extended attributes of your VM, which your VM can then access via a "guestinfo" interface.
These extended attributes are `guestinfo.userdata` and `guestinfo.userdata.encoding`.

`guestinfo.userdata` may be passed as base64, gzipped base64, or (least desirable) raw TOML.
Valid values for `guestinfo.userdata.encoding` are: `base64`, `b64`, `gzip+base64`, and `gz+b64`.

Given the above file `userdata.toml`, base64 encode and set user data for your VM:
```
export BR_USERDATA=$(cat userdata.toml | base64 -w0; echo)
govc vm.change -vm <YOUR VM NAME> -e guestinfo.userdata="${BR_USERDATA}" -e guestinfo.userdata.encoding="base64"
```

You can check that your user data was set:
```
govc vm.info -e -r -t <YOUR VM NAME>
```

## Launch!
Once you've created your user data, given your VM a way to access it via guestinfo or CD-ROM, you can launch a Bottlerocket VM in your cluster!
```
govc vm.power -on <YOUR VM NAME>
```

Once it launches, you should be able to use your Bottlerocket instance using normal Kubernetes workflows.
All boot output should be visible in the vSphere console if you need to troubleshoot.
